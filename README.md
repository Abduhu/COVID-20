# COVID-19

COVID-19 mathematical modeling

This repository is aimed to contain the programs used for dynamical modeling of COVID-19 spread  with SEIQRDP compartmental model.

The set of programs based on Python 3.7 is being prepared for public sharing and would be soon available on this reposetory. Stay tuned.

This reposetory will also contain an agent-based program for epidemic spread simulation.
