# COVID-19

/SEIRQDP
COVID-19 modeling using a generalized SEIR model.

A tailored set of codes has been developed under Python 3.7 to:

- download data from the online COVID-19 data repository
- determine the optimum fitting depth using cross-validation method
- calibrate the model by applying a genetic fitting algrothm to the real data 
- perform forecast modeling
