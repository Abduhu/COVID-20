# COVID-19

/SEIRQDP
COVID-19 modeling using a generalized SEIR model.

A tailored set of codes has been developed under Python 3.7.6 to:

- download data from the Github repository
- determine the optimum fitting depth using cross-validation method
- calibrate the model by fitting the real data 
- perform forecast modeling 

Fitting is based on the functions of the optimize module from SciPy v1.4.1
